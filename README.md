beam-webservice
===============

This is a sandbox repository used to investigate into various technologies
enabling BEAM web-service. A BEAM web-service could serve as possibility 
to access the BEAM Java API from other programming languages using a local
server and hereby allowing for elegant inter-process communication. 

The respository includes two submodules (both very experimental):
* ´beam-jaxws´: Uses [JAX-WS|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services]
* ´beam-jsonrcp´: Uses [JSON-RPC|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC] enabled by [Jackson|https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core]
